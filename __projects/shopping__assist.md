# 🔹 MVP: AI Shopping Assistant Bot + Dashboard

### 🎯 Goal

A **Telegram bot** that acts as a virtual shop assistant:

- Greets customers.
- Asks what they’re looking for.
- Recommends products from your **inventory (JSON storage)**.
- Suggests **related/similar products**.
- Lets users add items to their **cart**.
- Sends **notifications to the Vue dashboard + Telegram group** for admins.

This MVP shows:

- **Bot automation** (aiogram + FastAPI backend).
- **AI-enhanced shopping flow** (LangChain/Ollama for recommendations, Q\&A).
- **Frontend dashboard** (Vue) for **real-time shop monitoring**.

### 🔹 User Flow (Bot Side)

1. **Greeting**

   - Bot says: “👋 Hi! Welcome to SmartShop. What are you looking for today?”

2. **Need Discovery**

   - User types: “I want headphones”
   - Bot searches **inventory** + uses **Ollama** to rank best matches.

3. **Recommendations**

   - Bot replies with product options:

     ```
     🎧 Wireless Headphones - $49
     🎧 Noise Cancelling Headphones - $89
     ```

   - Each has inline buttons: `[Add to cart]` `[More like this]`.

4. **Related Products**

   - If user clicks "More like this," bot suggests **similar/related items**.

5. **Cart**

   - When user clicks "Add to cart":

     - Bot confirms: ✅ Added to cart.
     - Sends notification to:

       - **Vue Dashboard (via FastAPI WebSocket or polling)**.
       - **Telegram admin group** ("User @alex added Wireless Headphones to cart").

6. **Checkout (optional in MVP)**

   - Bot summarizes cart:

     ```
     🛒 Your Cart:
     - Wireless Headphones ($49)
     - Phone Case ($10)
     Total: $59
     ```
