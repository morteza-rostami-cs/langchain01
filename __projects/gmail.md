Perfect 💡 — you want to **supercharge Gmail with automation + LLMs** using your stack (**Python, FastAPI, LangChain, Ollama, Vue.js, JSON, Telegram bot API**) — no custom ML, just LLM-powered logic & clever engineering.

Let’s brainstorm **20 features** (like your Gmail → Telegram important-mail example).

# 📧 20 Ways to Automate Gmail with LLMs

### **Filtering & Prioritization**

1. **LLM-based priority filter** → Only forward _important_ emails (clients, job applications, invoices) to Telegram; skip ads, newsletters.
2. **Smart category labeling** → Auto-label emails as _Work, Finance, Family, Shopping, Spam, Promotions_.
3. **Summarized daily digest** → Send a Telegram digest each morning summarizing _important unread emails_.
4. **Ad/newsletter killer** → LLM flags “marketing-speak” and hides or groups all promotions.
5. **Urgency detector** → Highlight emails that _require reply today_ (e.g., “ASAP”, “deadline”, “last reminder”).

### **Search & Retrieval**

6. **Natural language query** → Ask: “Show me all invoices from last month” → bot returns relevant emails.
7. **Semantic search** → Search by intent instead of exact words (“find the email where my manager mentioned database migration”).
8. **Cross-channel forwarding** → Forward only certain categories (e.g., job offers → Telegram, receipts → Google Sheets).
9. **Attachment search** → Ask bot: “Find the PDF contract from Ali” → returns email with attachment.
10. **Topic clustering** → Group related email threads automatically (e.g., “Job Interviews”, “Bank Updates”).

### **Productivity / Reply Assistance**

11. **Auto-summarize long threads** → Get 3–4 sentence summaries of multi-reply email chains.
12. **Quick reply drafting** → LLM suggests short replies (e.g., “Yes, let’s do 3 PM tomorrow”).
13. **Action item extraction** → Pull tasks from emails (“Submit report by Friday”) into JSON → Telegram todo list.
14. **Politeness / tone rewriter** → Rewrite drafts to be more formal / concise before sending.
15. **Reply links in Telegram** → Each forwarded message has a button → “Reply in Gmail” (opens compose window with recipient pre-filled).

### **Organization / Enrichment**

16. **Contact importance ranking** → Track frequent senders and prioritize their emails.
17. **Smart tagging** → Add tags like `#invoice`, `#job`, `#legal` in JSON metadata for easier filtering.
18. **Calendar extraction** → LLM finds event details (“Meeting on Sep 15, 3 PM”) → auto-add to Google Calendar API.
19. **Expense tracking** → Parse receipts → log totals into JSON/CSV → later push into finance app.
20. **Auto-archive rules** → Auto-move old newsletters / updates to archive if untouched after 3 days.

### 🔧 How this fits your stack:

- **Python + FastAPI** → Gmail API fetcher + backend to expose filtered/summarized emails.
- **LangChain + Ollama** → Categorization, summarization, semantic search, draft replies.
- **JSON storage** → Store metadata: `{sender, subject, tags, summary, urgency, link}`.
- **Telegram bot** → Send important/summarized emails with reply links/buttons.
- **Vue.js** → Optional dashboard for managing rules, categories, and browsing email history.

👉 Question for you:
Do you want me to **prioritize these into an MVP Gmail Bot** (like: important email filter + digest + Telegram push),
or do you want me to go **full system design blueprint** (API endpoints, JSON schema, prompt templates, integration flow)?
