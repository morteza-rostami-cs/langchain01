Perfect üöÄ You‚Äôre thinking like a real software architect here ‚Äî **design business logic first, interfaces later**, and keep it extendable with OOP + SOLID. Since you want a **list of atomic tasks** that will step-by-step lead you to a **complete pseudo-code MVP sketch** (in one file), I‚Äôll break it into the right granularity.

---

# üìù Atomic Task Plan (for Pseudo-code Design)

## **Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Entities (Domain Layer)**

1. **Define Product entity**

   - Properties: `id, name, description, price, discount, stock`.
   - Method: maybe `final_price()` (applies discount).

2. **Define CartItem entity**

   - Properties: `product, quantity`.
   - Methods: `increase()`, `decrease()`, `subtotal()`.

3. **Define Cart entity**

   - Holds list of `CartItem`.
   - Methods: `add_item()`, `remove_item()`, `total_price()`, `list_items()`.

---

## **Phase 2 ‚Äì Inventory + Storage**

4. **Define Inventory entity**

   - Loads products from JSON.
   - Methods: `search(query)`, `get_by_id()`, `list_all()`.

5. **Abstract Storage layer**

   - Interface `IStorage` with methods: `load_products()`, `save_cart()`.
   - Concrete: `JsonStorage` implementation.
   - (Later swappable for DB).

---

## **Phase 3 ‚Äì Services (Business Logic)**

6. **Define RecommendationService**

   - Input: user query.
   - Output: ranked list of products.
   - Implementation: stub AI call (`LangChain/Ollama`) but keep it abstract (`IRecommendationEngine`).

7. **Define ShopService (facade/service layer)**

   - Orchestrates:

     - Greeting.
     - Asking clarifying questions (loop until clear query).
     - Calls `Inventory` + `RecommendationService`.
     - Handles adding to cart.
     - Emits notifications.

---

## **Phase 4 ‚Äì User Interaction Layer**

8. **Define UI (Terminal Interface)**

   - Handles input/print for MVP.
   - Connects only to `ShopService`.
   - Provides:

     - Menu (`back to shop`).
     - Product recommendation view with `[Add to cart]`.
     - Cart view with `[inc/dec/remove]`.

---

## **Phase 5 ‚Äì Notifications + Extensibility**

9. **Notification System**

   - Define `INotifier` interface.
   - Concrete: `FakeNotifier` (prints "Admin: user added X").
   - (Later: TelegramNotifier, WebsocketNotifier).

---

## **Phase 6 ‚Äì Application Entry Point**

10. **Main App Runner**

    - Setup storage + inventory + services + notifier.
    - Loop: simulate user session with terminal UI.

---

# ‚úÖ Deliverable

If you do all 10 tasks one by one, you‚Äôll end up with **one single file of pseudo-code** that clearly sketches:

- Entities (OOP, SOLID).
- Business logic decoupled from UI/storage.
- Extensible system where later you can swap JSON ‚Üí DB, terminal ‚Üí Telegram/Vue, FakeNotifier ‚Üí real ones.

üëâ Do you want me to **start with Task 1 ("Define Product entity")** right away in pseudo-code form, or do you first want me to show you a **high-level class diagram sketch** so you see the relationships before coding?
