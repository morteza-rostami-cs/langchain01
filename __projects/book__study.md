Perfect ⚡ — now we’re designing an **LLM-powered study companion app for philosophy books** (Plato’s _Republic_ as example).

Goal: not just summarization, but **concept discovery, deep exploration, bookmarking, and cross-connections**.
Stack: **Python + FastAPI + LangChain + Ollama + Vue.js + JSON storage**.

Here’s a brainstorm of **20 practical features**:

# 📚 20 Features for an LLM Study App (Philosophy Companion)

### **Core Understanding & Summarization**

1. **Chapter-wise summaries** → Drop the book → get concise summaries per chapter/section.
2. **Concept extraction** → LLM highlights key philosophical concepts (e.g., _justice, forms, philosopher-king_).
3. **Glossary builder** → Auto-build glossary of philosophical terms with explanations.
4. **Argument mapping** → LLM breaks down major arguments into premises → conclusions.
5. **Character/concept tracking** → Keep track of who says what (e.g., Socrates, Glaucon).

### **Exploration & Learning**

6. **Ask-anything Q\&A** → “What does Plato mean by the Allegory of the Cave?” → bot answers.
7. **Cross-concept connections** → “How does Plato’s idea of justice connect to Aristotle’s?”
8. **Historical context expansion** → Bot explains cultural/political background.
9. **Comparison mode** → Compare _Republic_ with another work (_Nicomachean Ethics_, _Meditations_).
10. **Alternative interpretations** → LLM provides different schools of thought (e.g., modern, existentialist).

### **Personal Study Tools**

11. **Bookmark passages & concepts** → Save a section + notes in JSON.
12. **Flashcards auto-generation** → Convert concepts into Q\&A flashcards for practice.
13. **Daily quiz mode** → Bot quizzes you on what you’ve read/bookmarked.
14. **Learning path** → Suggests which chapters/concepts to read next.
15. **Annotation assistant** → You highlight text → bot expands/explains meaning.

### **Memory & Progress Tracking**

16. **Concept graph visualization** → Vue.js renders an interactive map of concepts & relationships.
17. **Progress tracker** → Shows % of book studied, concepts learned, flashcards mastered.
18. **Personal notes integration** → You add notes → bot refines & links them to concepts.
19. **Custom study goals** → “Learn 5 concepts a day” → bot suggests content to review.
20. **Study timeline digest** → Weekly summary: _“You explored 12 new concepts: justice, democracy, education…”_.

### 🔧 Tech Mapping

- **FastAPI** → Handles uploads (book PDFs/text), API routes for summaries, Q\&A, flashcards.
- **LangChain + Ollama** → Summarization, concept extraction, Q\&A, comparisons.
- **JSON storage** → Saves user progress, bookmarks, flashcards, study notes.
- **Vue.js** → Frontend study dashboard: concept map, flashcards, progress bar, bookmarks.
- **Prompt engineering** → Ensure consistent structured outputs (e.g., `{"concept": "...", "summary": "...", "related": [...]}`).

⚡ MVP version could be:

- Drop a book → chapter summaries + main concepts list.
- Bookmark concepts + flashcards auto-generation.
- Ask natural language questions about passages.
- Simple JSON-backed progress tracker.

👉 Do you want me to **sketch out a full JSON schema + API endpoints** for this app (like `Book`, `Concept`, `Flashcard`, `Note`),
or do you prefer I first **prioritize features into MVP vs. Advanced** like we did for Gmail/Telegram?
