Perfect! I can make a **comprehensive, step-by-step atomic task list** for learning **LangChain + Ollama/local LLMs**. Each task will be focused, accomplishable in a session, and build upon the previous ones. I’ll avoid LangGraph for now. By the end of the list, you’ll have covered all the **core LangChain concepts and workflows** with local models.

Here’s the plan:

---

# **LangChain + Ollama / Local LLMs – Atomic Task List**

   - Goal: Pass dynamic content (like user input) to a prompt template.
   - Understand: How LangChain handles variable substitution safely.

6. **Prompt Chaining: Sequential Prompt Execution**

   - Goal: Use two chained prompts where the output of the first feeds the second.
   - Understand: How chains model multi-step reasoning workflows.

### **Part 3: LLM Chains & Memory**

7. **Simple LLMChain with Ollama**

   - Goal: Create a chain that takes a prompt and generates a response.

8. **Add Conversation Memory to a Chain**

   - Goal: Use `ConversationBufferMemory` to store prior inputs and outputs.
   - Understand: How memory makes the model “context-aware” across multiple prompts.

9. **Experiment with Memory Types (Buffer vs Summary)**

   - Goal: Swap `ConversationBufferMemory` with `ConversationSummaryMemory`.
   - Understand: When to summarize history vs keeping full context.

### **Part 4: Agents & Tools**

10. **Define a Custom Tool**

    - Goal: Create a Python function and wrap it as a LangChain Tool.
    - Understand: How LangChain agents can call external tools for reasoning.

11. **Create a Simple Agent with Ollama**

    - Goal: Use `initialize_agent` with a local LLM and one tool.
    - Understand: How agents dynamically select tools based on user queries.

12. **Add Multiple Tools to an Agent**

    - Goal: Make the agent choose from 2–3 tools for reasoning tasks.
    - Understand: How LangChain parses queries to select appropriate tools.

13. **Control Agent’s Reasoning with Custom Prompt Templates**

    - Goal: Modify the agent’s instructions for better decision-making.
    - Understand: How prompt design guides tool usage and reasoning.

### **Part 5: Chains Beyond Text**

14. **Use Output Parsers to Structure LLM Output**

    - Goal: Parse model outputs into JSON or Python objects.
    - Understand: Why structured outputs are crucial for downstream tasks.

15. **Create a Sequential Chain with Structured Output**

    - Goal: Chain multiple prompts that produce structured data at each step.
    - Understand: How structured data allows programmatic reasoning.

16. **Integrate Simple Conditional Logic in Chains**

    - Goal: Branch execution based on previous outputs.
    - Understand: How to build simple “if-this-then-that” flows with LLMs.

---

### **Part 6: Embeddings & Vector Stores**

17. **Generate Embeddings from Text**

    - Goal: Use Ollama or OpenAI embeddings locally.
    - Understand: How embeddings represent semantic meaning.

18. **Store Embeddings in a Vector Store (e.g., FAISS)**

    - Goal: Index text for semantic search.
    - Understand: How vector search retrieves relevant content efficiently.

19. **Perform Semantic Search with Vector Store**

    - Goal: Query the vector store for similar text snippets.
    - Understand: How retrieval augments LLM responses with context.

20. **Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

    - Goal: Combine a retriever with an LLMChain for context-aware answers.
    - Understand: Why RAG improves factual accuracy and specificity.

### **Part 7: Advanced Workflows**

21. **Create a Self-Ask with Search Agent**

    - Goal: Chain LLM reasoning with multiple retrieval calls.
    - Understand: How to decompose complex questions into smaller queries.

22. **Implement a Local Knowledge Base Query System**

    - Goal: Store a PDF or text documents and query them with Ollama.
    - Understand: How local LLMs + LangChain can replace cloud queries.

23. **Experiment with Custom Callbacks for Logging**

    - Goal: Track LLM input/output and token usage with `CallbackHandler`.
    - Understand: How to debug and monitor chain executions.

24. **Fine-Tune Prompt Templates for Multi-Turn Tasks**

    - Goal: Improve multi-step conversation or workflow prompts.
    - Understand: How prompt engineering impacts agent reasoning quality.

### ✅ **End Goal**

- By completing all these atomic tasks, you will have a working knowledge of:

  - LangChain core classes: `LLMChain`, `PromptTemplate`, `Memory`, `Agent`
  - Tool creation and agent orchestration
  - Retrieval-augmented generation with local models
  - Embeddings, vector stores, and semantic search
  - Callbacks, structured outputs, and multi-step workflows

- And you’ll be ready to **build complex local LLM applications with Ollama**.

If you want, I can **now make a super-condensed “task runner version”** where each task is **one-liner ready to paste into GPT**, so we can go **step by step interactively** without extra reading.

Do you want me to do that next?
